    "notes": "1. We covered the importance of having clear goals in social change and knowing how to properly engage your stakeholders.\n\n2. We ran a stakeholder mapping and power analysis exercise https://www.fabriders.net/spectrogram-stakeholder-map/ to better understand how people working on social change develop strategies and campaigning\n\n3. We then talked about the importance of getting your stakeholders involved early and often while building your social change campaign strategy. Where user centred design becomes important is in understanding your stakeholders motivations and perspectives.  How does the change you are trying to make provide them with value?  More can be found here: https://www.fabriders.net/hacking-user-centred-design/\n\nAlso, on Greenpeace's approach to design centred campaigning. http://www.mobilisationlab.org/training/campaign-accelerator\n",
