In fact, 95% of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language and denigrating images in online spaces are aimed at women — making this a gendered issue. This session is highly interactive, and the goal is for participants to come out with strategies that allow them to be effective allies for vulnerable female journalists.\n\nSession Goals\n\n\t1.
