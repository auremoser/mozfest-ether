This allows you to collaborate seamlessly on documents!\n\nWhat we did with iPython notebooks:\n     - cloned using github or downloaded zip of https://github.com/sonyahanson/mozfest-assaytools\n     - went to this new directory and typed 'ipython notebook' (might require installation of ipython and jupyter)\n     - opened 'Simulating a Binding Dataset.ipynb' and ran through each cell (might require installation of matplotlib, numpy, and scipy)\n\n\n\n\n",
