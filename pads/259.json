Participants will learn how these technologies can be used to manage communications and contributions within a team. At the end of the session, the contributions of all participants will be collated and used to produce an overall team plot.\nThese very basic skills should form a good foundation for participants to start coordinating collaboration on their own projects and develop their skills further through practice. Thatâ€™s how I learnt!\nNB. Participants will get the most out of their session if they bring their own laptops.\n\nGitHub Repository link:\nhttps://github.com/annakrystalli/Mozfest_github-rstudio\n    \nSession Facilitators:\nAnna Krystalli, @annakrystalli\nSharada Prasanna Mohanty @MeMohanty\n\nParticipants:\nAlissa Nedossekina, @snowwitje Purdue University\n    \nAgenda:\nhttps://annakrystalli.github.io/Mozfest_github-rstudio/index.html\n\nPRACTICALS\n\nPractical 1: Github & Rstudio for version control\nhttps://github.com/mikecroucher/ISBE_Symposium\n    \nOther Useful Links:  \n\n",
