The art world has trained participants to look for emerging trends and cultures, ethnographically speaking. While the tech world is hinged upon searching for the newest boundary and innovation, it is not ethnographically, historically, or culturally aware, with the exception of existing and emerging ethnographic research on social media. \n    \n\tLonger resources: \n\tAbstracts are available here: http://dml2016.dmlhub.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Identity-Making-In-Online-Spaces.pdf and are attached as a resource file below. \n\t\n\t240 - Individual Session        Research\n\t\"#QueeringThePresent, #QueryingTheFuture: Digital queer gestures on twitter, transforming discourses, and performativities of new possible futures\n\tJose Lizarraga | UC Berkeley | @sapoverde\n\tArturo Cortez | UC Berkeley | @FineArturo\n\t48 - Individual Session        Research\n\tTumblr is a Place to Express Myself”: Digital Design Considerations for Queer Youth of Color Activism\n\tAlexander Cho | UC Irvine\n\t69 - Individual Session        Research\n\tAdolescents' Experiences of Co-Constructed Identity on Social Media\n\tSusannah Stern | University of San Diego\n\tOlivia        Gonzalez | University of San Diego\n\t112 - Individual Session        Research\n\tFirst in our Families: First generation college students, storytelling, and equity\n\tJane        Van Galen | University of Washington Bothell | @jvg\n\t \n\t\n      \nGet involved with Etherpad at http://etherpad.org\n\n",
